\section{Scope and Limitations \label{Section::Scope and Limitations}}
Scope refers to the boundaries of what a project or system will include, while limitations refer to the factors that could restrict or hinder the project or system's development or use. Here are some examples of scope and limitations:
\subsection{Scope} -The scope of a project to build a new hospital might include designing and constructing the building, installing medical equipment and systems, hiring and training staff, and establishing policies and procedures for patient care and safety.\\
-The scope of an e-commerce website might include developing a user-friendly interface, integrating with a payment gateway, establishing a product catalog, and setting up a secure database for customer information.
\subsection{Limitations:} -The limitations of a hospital project might include constraints on the budget, timeline, or available resources, such as the availability of land, equipment, or qualified staff.\\
-The limitations of an e-commerce website might include technical constraints, such as compatibility with different devices and browsers, or legal constraints, such as compliance with data privacy and security regulations.
\section{Business context \label{Section::Business context}}

\quad An In-Hospital Management System (IHMS) is a software application designed to support the operations of a healthcare facility, including patient care, medical records management, resource allocation, and administrative tasks.\\

In today's healthcare landscape, hospitals and clinics are facing increased pressure to provide high-quality patient care while maintaining operational efficiency. The use of IHMS can help address these challenges by streamlining processes and improving communication and collaboration between healthcare providers.\\
Here are some key business contexts for implementing an IHMS:\\
-Improved patient care: With an IHMS, healthcare providers can access up-to-date patient information and medical records in real-time, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced medical errors.\\

-Increased efficiency: The automation of administrative tasks such as appointment scheduling and medication management can save time and increase operational efficiency.\\

-Better resource allocation: By having a centralized system for managing patient information and resources, healthcare facilities can allocate resources more effectively and reduce waste.\\

-Enhanced communication: With an IHMS, healthcare providers can communicate and collaborate more effectively, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced medical errors.\\

-Improved compliance: An IHMS can help healthcare facilities stay compliant with industry regulations and standards by tracking and reporting on key metrics such as patient care and resource utilization.\\


Overall, the implementation of an IHMS can help healthcare facilities improve patient care, increase operational efficiency, and stay compliant with industry regulations, making it an attractive solution for hospitals and clinics looking to improve their operations.
